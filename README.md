# React APP w/ Spotify API

This [project](https://leomoleiro95.github.io/Music/) is a React base Web app which levers Spotify's API to build your own playlist in a few steps.

1. Search for a song (Spotify will ask you to login into your account)
2. Add your desired song by clicking the " + " button
3. On the right side you will see the songs that will be included in your new Spotify Playlist
4. Add a unique playlists name and press Submit
5. Turn up the volume!

Cheers,
Leo
